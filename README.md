# Lane_Detection_using_opencv
In this project ,  Car lanes are detected on a sample road video &amp;  image  by using opencv_techniques and concepts.
It is done in 3 parts.
### Concepts used :
##### 1 Grayscaling Images (Easier to apply Blur and edge detection on grayscaled image)
##### 2 Gaussian Blur (to reduce video & image noise)
##### 3 Canny edge Detection (to detect wide range of edges using inbuilt multi-stage algorithm)
##### 4 Region of interest & Masking (To mask out the region that wasn't concerned with the road lanes)
##### 5 Hough line transform method (To draw lines on lanes by detecting them based on arguments provided)
#####
